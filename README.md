## How to Use

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/benduse/ejo-app.git
    cd ejo-app
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies (if any, for development tools):**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Install a Local Web Server (if you don't have one):**
    This project is a static site and requires a local web server to function correctly (e.g., to fetch JSON data). If you don't have `http-server` installed globally, you can install it:
    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```
4.  **Start the Application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start a local server (usually on `http://localhost:8080`).
5.  **Open in Browser:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by the `npm start` command (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
